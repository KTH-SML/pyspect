# pyspect

**OBS:** pyspect is in active development. This branch contains examples for _"Guaranteed Completion of Complex Tasks via Temporal Logic Trees and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability"_ that showcase what pyspect strives to become.

The examples can be found [here](examples/cdc24.ipynb).

This version of pyspect comes packaged with [`hj_reachability`](https://github.com/StanfordASL/hj_reachability) and [`optimized_dp`](https://github.com/sfu-mars/optimized_dp). Both have been slightly modified to improve interfaces with pyspect.
